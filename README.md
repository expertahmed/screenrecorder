## Additional Notes

- **Python Version**: Ensure that Python 3.12 or later is used as it provides support for modern features and libraries.
- **Permissions**: Administrative or sudo privileges are required for certain installation steps, especially for creating desktop shortcuts and installing system-wide dependencies.
- **Audio Input**: Ensure the microphone or audio input device is properly connected and selected in the application settings.
- **Dependencies**: The `requirements.txt` file should contain all necessary Python packages required for the application.

By following these steps, you can set up and run the screen recording application on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Each platform has its specific steps, mainly due to differences in package management and system configurations.
