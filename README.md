To include FFmpeg in the setup process, you need to ensure that FFmpeg is installed and available in the system's PATH so that the application can utilize it for combining audio and video files.

Here's how you can update the setup instructions for Windows, Linux, and macOS to include FFmpeg:

## Installation Steps

### Windows

#### 1. **Install Python**
   - Download and install Python 3.12 or later from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - During installation, ensure you select the option to add Python to your PATH.

#### 2. **Install Git (optional)**
   - Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) if you want to clone the repository directly.

#### 3. **Install FFmpeg**
   - Download FFmpeg from the [FFmpeg official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). Choose the Windows build from a trusted source like [Gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/).
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file and copy the `bin` folder path (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`).
   - Add this path to the system's PATH environment variable:
     - Right-click on "This PC" or "My Computer" and select "Properties."
     - Click on "Advanced system settings."
     - Click on "Environment Variables."
     - Under "System variables," find and select "Path," then click "Edit."
     - Click "New" and paste the FFmpeg bin folder path.
     - Click "OK" to save and close all dialog boxes.

#### 4. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open Command Prompt and run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/expertahmed/screenrecorder.git
     cd screenrecorder
     ```

#### 5. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator and navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

#### 6. **Install Required Packages**
   - Install the necessary packages using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

#### 7. **Run the Setup Script**
   - Run the setup script to install the application and create a desktop shortcut:
     ```bash
     python setup.py install
     ```

#### 8. **Run the Application**
   - Use the desktop shortcut created by the setup script to start the application.
   - Alternatively, you can run the application manually:
     ```bash
     python src\main.py
     ```

### Linux

#### 1. **Install Python and Pip**
   - Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. If not, use the package manager to install Python:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update

     ```

#### 2. **Install Git (optional)**
   - If you want to clone the repository directly:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install git
     ```

#### 3. **Install FFmpeg**
   - Install FFmpeg using the package manager:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
     ```

#### 4. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/expertahmed/screenrecorder.git
     cd screenrecorder
     ```

#### 5. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   - Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

#### 6. **Install Required Packages**
   - Install the necessary packages using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

#### 7. **Run the Setup Script**
   - Run the setup script to install the application and create a desktop shortcut:
     ```bash
     sudo python setup.py install
     ```

#### 8. **Run the Application**
   - Use the desktop shortcut created by the setup script to start the application.
   - Alternatively, you can run the application manually:
     ```bash
     python src/main.py
     ```

### macOS

#### 1. **Install Python and Pip**
   - Use Homebrew to install Python if itâ€™s not already installed:
     ```bash
     brew install python
     ```

#### 2. **Install Git (optional)**
   - Install Git if you want to clone the repository directly:
     ```bash
     brew install git
     ```

#### 3. **Install FFmpeg**
   - Use Homebrew to install FFmpeg:
     ```bash
     brew install ffmpeg
     ```

#### 4. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open Terminal and run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/expertahmed/screenrecorder.git
     cd screenrecorder
     ```

#### 5. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   - Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate

     python src/main.py
     ```

## Additional Notes

- **Python Version**: Ensure that Python 3.12 or later is used as it provides support for modern features and libraries.
- **Permissions**: Administrative or sudo privileges are required for certain installation steps, especially for creating desktop shortcuts and installing system-wide dependencies.
- **FFmpeg**: Ensure FFmpeg is correctly installed and added to your system's PATH so it can be called by the application.
- **Audio Input**: Ensure the microphone or audio input device is properly connected and selected in the application settings.
- **Dependencies**: The `requirements.txt` file should contain all necessary Python packages required for the application.

By following these steps, you can set up and run the screen recording application on Windows, Linux, and macOS, ensuring FFmpeg is available for audio and video processing.
